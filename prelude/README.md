# Checked foundations

`init.mech` defines nine SMu families and ten functions without axioms or
primitives.  The test harness checks it in `Global.empty`.  This prevents
the driver's initial `Nat` axiom from supplying a hidden dependency.

The data families are `MechNat`, `MechBool`, `MechUnit`, `MechEmpty`,
`MechSum`, and `MechDecidable`.  They live at `Type 0`.  `MechTrue` and
`MechFalse` live at `Prop`.  Decidable has two data constructors with
erased proof fields.  It does not resolve instances or decide propositions.
`MechPi` and `MechSigma` expand to the existing function and dependent pair
forms.  These declarations are monomorphic at the stated universes.

`MechProofEq` is restricted to two proofs of the same proposition.
`mechProofRefl` and `mechProofJ` check for that family, and J has a
Prop-valued motive that depends on both endpoints and the equality proof.
This restricted family is not a mapping target for Lean's general `Eq`.
Proof irrelevance already identifies its endpoints.  Its constructor has
a runtime witness field, so the existing subsingleton check refuses
large elimination.

General indexed equality at `Prop` remains blocked.  The frozen checker
requires each SMu index type to live at or below the family's universe.
For a carrier `A : Type 0`, an endpoint `x : A` therefore cannot index a
family at `Prop`.  Moving the endpoint into a constructor field also
fails its universe bound.  The two `eq-*.mech` negatives preserve these
diagnostics.  No equality postulate or cast bypasses either check.

The source client in `test/fixtures/prelude/client.mech` checks after this
file.  It constructs values, exercises dependent fields and nested
constructors, and uses singleton indices to check recursor computation.
The harness also checks rejection diagnostics in `test/neg/prelude`.

Parameterized constructors use the local surface elaborator overlay.
The expected family type supplies its parameters.  Each field elaborates
at its declared type under the parameters and preceding fields.  The
unchanged kernel checks the complete constructor and its result indices.
